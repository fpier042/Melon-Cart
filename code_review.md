# Code Review Findings

## Security Issues
1. **Hard-coded Secret Key** (shoppingsite.py, line 17)
   - The Flask secret key is hard-coded in the source code
   - Recommendation: Move to environment variable

2. **Incomplete Login Implementation** (shoppingsite.py, lines 135-157)
   - Login functionality is not implemented
   - Currently returns "Oops! This needs to be implemented"
   - Sensitive user information could be exposed
   - TODO comments indicate needed implementation details

## Functionality Issues
1. **Session Management**
   - No session expiry configuration
   - No logout functionality implemented
   - Cart persists in session indefinitely

2. **Error Handling**
   - Limited error handling for invalid melon_id in show_melon()
   - No validation on cart quantities
   - No maximum cart size limits

3. **Missing Features**
   - Checkout functionality not implemented (marked as future version)
   - No input validation on cart operations
   - No user registration functionality

## Performance Considerations
1. **Database Operations**
   - Melons and customer data stored in text files
   - Consider using a proper database for scalability

## Recommendations
1. Implement proper login/authentication system
2. Move configuration to environment variables
3. Add proper error handling throughout
4. Add input validation
5. Implement session management and logout
6. Add rate limiting for cart operations
7. Consider adding automated tests
8. Implement proper database storage
9. Add security headers to Flask application
10. Implement CSRF protection

## Good Practices Observed
1. Use of Flask blueprints
2. Clear code organization
3. Good documentation and comments
4. Use of templates with Jinja2
5. Session-based shopping cart implementation
